# Todo Application Backend with Node.js

This project represents a modern clean backend for a **Todo Application**, integrating the most recent technologies in a cohesive and efficient manner:

1. **Node.js:**  
   Node.js enables asynchronous code execution, allowing multiple requests to be handled concurrently without blocking. This non-blocking nature ensures high scalability and responsiveness under heavy loads.

2. **TypeScript:**  
   By using TypeScript— a strongly typed language— errors are caught at compile time, improving code reliability. This is especially beneficial in large, complex projects, as it allows developers to confidently implement changes and enhancements while maintaining code quality.

3. **Clean Architecture:**  
   The adoption of Clean Architecture guarantees a clear separation of concerns: business logic, data access, and user interaction reside in distinct layers. This design not only simplifies maintenance and testing but also enables continuous development and seamless updates without impacting unrelated components.

4. **Express:**  
   As a lightweight yet powerful framework, Express facilitates the creation of structured RESTful APIs. With its robust routing and middleware management, the framework provides the modern design and flexibility needed for scalable application development.

5. **Prisma:**  
   One of the highlights of this project is the use of Prisma as a modern ORM. Prisma offers powerful type-safety and a smooth developer experience when interacting with the MySQL database, simplifying complex SQL queries into clean, readable code. This setup enhances data security and accelerates the overall development process.

6. **MySQL:**  
   MySQL, as a relational database, plays a foundational role in storing and managing the project's data. It not only standardizes the data but also supports transactions and complex queries—features essential for a high-performing Todo Application.
